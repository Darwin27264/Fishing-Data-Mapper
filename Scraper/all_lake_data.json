Zooplankton began to reappear in 1985, gradually becoming more abundant and diverse through the spring and summer months.  By late summer species such as Leptodora kindtii, Holopedium gibberellum, Polyphemus pediculus and Daphnia spp., which had been absent for a number of years, were reappearing along with Diaptomus sp., Keratella cochlearis, Kellicottia longispina, Bosmina longirostris, B. coregoni, Cyclops sp. and Polyarthra sp.

Most winters, the north and\nsouth ends of the lake freeze over for about a kilometer or two from their\nends. Occasionally, the entire lake freezes over. The lake is utilized\nprimarily as a water source for five municipalities in the area and the\nresidents around the lake perimeter. Secondarily, it is used for recreation,\nflow equalization, and, to a limited extent, power. There are several public\nrecreation areas around the lake which provide for summer swimming, boating\nand fishing.
